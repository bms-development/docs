### How do I get a business?

Businesses are sold by a realtor agent. Many businesses already exist and may become vacant if the owner abandons it.&#x20;



### Can I request a custom business?

Business proposals are always welcome, however if the business type doesn't already exist such as you want something custom made that isn't in the city, you can request one by opening a ticket with your well thought proposal. If accepted, you'll need to become a tier 4 patreon before development begins. &#x20;
