# ðŸ’µ Register

We're all in business to make money! To make money, you need to make sales!&#x20;

## Employees

The only way for employees to make sales is to Third Eye the cash register. This will open up a menu that allows you to create a sale when a civilian is near. This applies to all businesses, but we will use Bean Machine for the examples here. \
\
Owners & Managers have additional access that allows them to Edit Prices and Withdraw Register Cash.&#x20;

Creating a Sale: When a sale is requested, Third Eye the register and select Create Sale. You will then select the name of the person who is wishing to purchase something. RP to find out what they are wanting to buy!

There are 2 kinds of Sales:

* &#x20;Inventory Sales & General Sales. Inventory Sales are the most used. This will open a menu that allows you to input the quantity of the item to sell based on inventory. Once the customer accepts the sale by either paying with cash or bank, money is taken out of the customer's account and the item is pulled from business inventory and given to the customer in their pockets. (You may have to do this more than once if they are purchasing more than 1 kind of item.)
* General Sales will open a menu that allows you to input a dollar amount to charge the customer. No product is given to the customer.
