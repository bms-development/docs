# v.1.0.4

## **What's New?**

* Added over <mark style="color:blue;">25 new clothing items</mark> and hair for females. The clothing pack has been recompiled, meaning all <mark style="color:red;">preset outfits had shifts in their order; you'll need to remake them</mark> taking into account new clothing. This is hopefully the only time this will happen. In game, everyone has access to a one time use <mark style="color:blue;">command /clothing to fix their ped immediately.</mark>&#x20;
* Added random Christmas trees with loot around the map. They auto generated and give a generous loot table.
* Added the new Gabz Mirror Park Christmas map, have fun hanging around there!

## Adjustments

* The casino is proving to be a very popular spot, <mark style="color:red;">let's change that</mark> (kidding). Horse betting time between races has been increased from 5 minutes to 20 minutes. <mark style="color:blue;">Minimum bet is now $1000</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">maximum is $10000 for the main event and 10-1500 for solos</mark>.&#x20;
* Trunk weights have been updated to realistic amounts due to a bug introduced a few weeks ago granting unlimited space.&#x20;
* Trailers have been added for sale at P.O.Ps.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug related to impound not setting vehicle properties. We are aware a similar issue is occurring at garages and it is being looked into actively.
