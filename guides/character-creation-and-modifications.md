# üßç Character Creation & Modifications

### **Creating a character.**

Creating a character is a point where a lot of decision making is made. It's your character, your story, your roleplay. You should have a broad idea of the path you want for your character, think of a clever name, a smart backstory, think about your goals and intentions.&#x20;

Am I playing a criminal? How will my character live his life? What does he/she do for money? Characters need purpose and story, throwaway characters are not allowed and every action you take in the city should progress your character's goals.

You can have up to six characters created at a time. If you wish to discontinue your character, please try to do so in RP by planning a scene where your character either leaves the city, or gets perma'd; if the situation allows it.

### Modifying your character.

You'll get a chance to modify your characters look and clothing on creation before your flown in on the plane. You can customize every bit of detail down to the facial features. If you decide you want to change your looks after creation, Mt. Zonah hospital has an area in the ER for plastic surgery to access the facial features menu again.

Any clothing store marked on the map can be used to modify your character's clothing and create fancy outfits for any occasion; no limits.
