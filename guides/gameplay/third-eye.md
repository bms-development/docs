# üëÅ Third Eye

Your Third Eye, or left alt muscle, is the basis of the targeting system for your character to interact with people and things in Blue Moon State. To use your third eye, press the left alt key on the keyboard, and a white eye will show up in the center of your screen, in place of a cursor. If you hover over an item, PED, or civilian, it will light up blue. You can then press your right mouse button and this will allow you to interact with the target. This is helpful for things like exiting your apartment, accessing your stash, clocking in and out at a job, and various other tasks that can be done in the city. Not everything is interactive, but your third eye will be your primary tool in the city.&#x20;
