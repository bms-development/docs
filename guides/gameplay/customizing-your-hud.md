* Change the shape of HUD Icons
* Enable or disable the mini-map when not in a vehicle
* Enable/disable alerts
* Show/Hide certain HUD icons at all times
* On the second tab of the HUD Menu (Status Icons), there are more options to personalize your HUD. You can change the size, position, colors, and where the icons are located on the screen.&#x20;
