# ðŸ“œ Applications

Got a hunger for the right side of the law? Think you can pass a bar exam? Apply for DoJ! We'd love to have you. You don't have to have any experience; we will train you from start to finish!&#x20;

To start the process, while in the city, head to City Services and request a meeting with DoJ. You would need to speak with the lady on the left side as you walk in and request an appointment.  (The lady may appear different than the image below.)

After requesting the appointment, a member of DoJ will reach out to you in city to meet and discuss the career path. If approved, you will need to pass the bar exam, which costs $6,000, and a background check. Once you have passed these requirements, your bar license will be issued and you will be hired on! Find out more details in RP!&#x20;
