# ‼ Your right to a lawyer

> _Sixth Amendment of the US Constitution_\
> \
> _In all crim­inal prosec­u­tions, **the accused shall enjoy the right** to a speedy and public trial, by an impar­tial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been commit­ted, which district shall have been previ­ously ascer­tained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accus­a­tion; to be confron­ted with the witnesses against him; to have compuls­ory process for obtain­ing witnesses in his favor, and **to have the assist­ance of coun­sel for his defense.**_&#x20;

Under the Sixth Amendment, if you are accused of a crime,  you are guaranteed the right to legal counsel, regardless of if you can afford one or not. The State of San Andreas does have Public Defenders available to be utilized, if the person being charged requests one. Private Attorneys are also available in the city. &#x20;

It is YOUR responsibility to request a lawyer. Police do not have to offer to obtain a lawyer for you.&#x20;
