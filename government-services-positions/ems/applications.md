# â˜‘ Applications

Are you interested in becoming a paramedic or doctor? Well, you need to fill out an application. Here are the following steps to do so!

First, you need to spend a minimum of two weeks in the city to get a feel for what the city is like and how it operates.

Once this requirement is complete, you may fill out an application which can be found in #create-application in Discord, and select EMS/Fire Applications

Once you are accepted, you will meet with the Chief of Medicine or a high command member where you will have a sit-down interview.

Post-Interview you will begin your training as an EMS recruit and start your career as a paramedic or doctor.&#x20;

It's a great day to save lives! \~ Derek Shepherd
