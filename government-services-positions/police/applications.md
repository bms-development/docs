# âœ… Applications

Applications for PD are going to consist of two things, Discord and being in the city. \
\
To first apply, you will find the application in Discord under City Applications. Once you complete the application, you wait for a member of Staff or Management to look it over and decide to accept or deny.&#x20;

Once you are accepted and given the role, a PD supervisor will be requested. You will be interviewed in game and hired, so you may begin your training.&#x20;
