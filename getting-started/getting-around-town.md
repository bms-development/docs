# ðŸš¶ Getting Around Town

### **Walking out of your apartment.**

So you're fresh in city, just now leaving your apartment to explore the world. You'll need means of transportation. The city tour guide is located right in front of the apartments. You can purchase a simple BMX bike to go short distances, perhaps to the nearest dealership a few blocks away.

### **Buying your first car.**

So you've made it to the nearest dealership. You'll want to quickly use your starter money to purchase a new vehicle. Simply walk up to a showroom vehicle, **press E to interact**, and go through all the available options.
