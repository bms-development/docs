# ‚úè Freelancing

### Looking to earn a quick buck?

There are many ways to earn money, there are dark ways and legal ways. Freelancing in the free market is one way that's separate from dedicating yourself to the job center. You can mine rocks, recycle goods, work for a business and be paid through the player economy, and more.

There are various markets located around the state to sell materials gained through mining or recycling. You can also use these materials for your own personal use at various crafting benches around the state.
