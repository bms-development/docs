### **What is it?**

These aren't your typical jobs you might be used to. These are career choices and professions. You choose a profession you want to take and level up through your career. You can work with others in the same profession to complete jobs faster and earn more experience.&#x20;

### **Choosing a profession**

Once you lock in a profession of choice (at the time of writing it's only sanitation) you will be able to start working three new jobs. Each profession allows you to work unique jobs with friends or alone. You can only take on one profession at a time but don't worry, in time you'll rack up enough experience to retire and start anew.

### Retirement

Once you reach a certain amount of experience, you'll be able to retire to master the field. Once retired, you'll be able to start a new profession while still being able to work the previous.&#x20;

Retiring also grants you a pension. A pension pays you out every X minutes for each profession you retired from, plus excess experience. There's no limit to how much you can be paid, if you put in the time, you'll see yourself amongst the top wealthy class.

### Keeping your record clean

You are not allowed to commit a crime while under the tenure of the city. If you do, a strike will be added to your record. If you get three strikes, you'll be suspended from working all jobs and a hold will be placed on any pensions you receive.&#x20;

Don't worry, you can state your case with the DOJ to appeal this suspension and get back working.
